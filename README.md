# FILE_SHARING


The project enables the users to secure data such as text, word docs, images, 
folders, etc., which are stored on android devices. To develop an application that 
can provide sense of security for the users who stores lots of sensitive and 
confidential information on device, in case the device is been accessed by 
someone, with the help of data security the data will not be able to be accessed. 
The main objective of initiating this project is to develop an android device file 
encryption and decryption system application that enables user to protect sensitive 
data on mobile devices by using the proposed system. 

The project involves the development of a mobile application that allows user to share and 
download file on their devices. This application will manage a file sharing site. The application 
uses the XML and JAVA framework. This application uses the firebase as database for storing 
files. There is a first signup screen. The user can see all the other users of dashboard and can 
share files with anyone. The decryption code is automatically sent to the user. User will enter the 
code in the app and then user can see the files shared and click on any user to share the file with 
them. Next screen shows, all the files shared with that person. Click on that button to share the 
file with the person. The app will automatically encrypt the file and send a decryption code to 
the user. Next enter the decryption code received. After entered the decryption code, it will show 
the file shared with user.
